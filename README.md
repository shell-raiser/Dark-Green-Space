# Dark-Green-Space
## A game made for the Coursera course "Game Design and Development 2: 2D Platformer"

----
There are 3 levels

Some changes I've made are:

* New music for Menu and Levels (from NCS music) and sound FX (made from scratch)
* New look, edited many assets to make it set into the green theme
* Level 1 is a 1D shooter (or whatever you call a game where you move in 1 dimension)
* Added Instructions
* A white snow-like light particle effect at in the main menu
* Changed Background and Player's Ship.
